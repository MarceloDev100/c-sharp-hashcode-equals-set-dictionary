### Project1 (Equals and GetHashCode methods)

:arrow_right: Pre-defined types already have implementation to that operations.

:arrow_right: __Equals:__

* Method that compares whether an object is equal to another one and returns true or false.

* It's a slow but accurate operation.

:arrow_right: __GetHashCode:__

* Method that returns an integer representing a code generated from object's information.

* It's a quick but not 100% operation. When comparing an object to other one, there may be a coincidence of equals numbers generated by the method.

:record_button: __GetHashCode golden rule:__ 

* After comparing two objects, if code generated of each one is not the same, so they are different.

* After comparing two objects, if code generated of each one is the same , they are probably the same, but a coincidence is not ruled out.

:arrow_right: __Custom Equals and GetHashCode:__

* A custom criterion can be made of when a client is equal to another one, for example.

* If a Client class has Name and Email attributes, one of them or both can be chosen to be a custom criterion to identify if an object is the same as the other one. In this example, the Email was chosen for this purpose. 

* The Equals and GetHashCode methods have been overriden in the Client class.

:record_button: the sign (==) compares object reference whereas Equals method compares the object content.
